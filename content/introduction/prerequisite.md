The Wordpress deployment will be created in an [AWS Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (VPC) which creates a virtual, software-defined network across AWS availability zones (AZs).  An availability zone is one or more physical data centers which are fault isolated from one another, providing you with a way to create resilient, fault-tolerant applications and architectures.

In the first lab you will create your own VPC in your AWS account and use the subnets and security groups you create to provision and protect your web application.

To get started you will visit the [AWS VPC web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home) and create your first VPC.
