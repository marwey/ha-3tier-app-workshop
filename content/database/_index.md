Now that you have created a virtual network across multiple data centers you will create a resilient, cached, highly-available data tier designed to support your Wordpress installation.  To do this you will, over the next 2 labs, create an active / passive database deployment using [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS) and then add caching to the database using the managed caching service [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/).
